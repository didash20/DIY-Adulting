# DIY Adulting
This web page will function as a blog for submiting content and information of how to become an adult. The web page is still and its first steps so not a lot of stuff has been uploaded. For now you will only see the home page with the initial concept. As time passes, the project will grow and more pages and content will be added.

All the content is in spanish as the target the project focuses are mexican young adults and teenagers. Anyhow, all the documentation will remain in english for international understanding.

## General info
The idea of DIY Adulting came from the thought that as young adults there is no such a good place to learn all the stuff that one must learn when growing up and starting being independent. Things like, how to apply for job applications, what are taxes and how to pay them, start living a life alone and plenty other stuff are things that we as people have to learn in a bad way. One can look for especific information, but there is not really a guide of how to do it.

The project will initially not contain any javascript, but can be added later if considered necesary.
